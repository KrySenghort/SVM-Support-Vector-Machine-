Stocks are believed by some to have patterns that can be identified with machine learning that repeat over time when fit to a vector. I used a support vector to forecast Stock adjusted close prices in the future for an emerging market 

I used a stock named ISCTR.IS in BIST 100.
The data I used was pulled from Yahoo Finance

Any stock in a similar data formatting can be used to replace the stock used in the demo

here's a link to yahoo finance if you want to download the data: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ISCTR.IS?p=ISCTR.IS&.tsrc=fin-srch


## STEPS
- [x] Import dependencies
- [x] Load Training Features Data
- [x] Turn data into a pandas data frame and Display
- [x] Replace the strings in thal column with corresponding numbers
- [x] Turn features into numpy arrays  
- [x] Check shape
- [x] Split the model 
- [x] Build the Model
- [x] Compile
- [x] Fit and train
- [x] Let's Evaluate Our Model with the loss function and accuracy

## Dependensies 
- [ ] Numpy
- [ ] Matplotlib(IF YOU WANT TO display trends, I put a # on them to help with processing speed)
- [ ] Scikit Learn
- [ ] Keras
- [ ] Tensorflow
- [ ] Math
- [ ] Pandas
